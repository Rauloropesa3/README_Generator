For someone creating a project the last thing they want to do is spend a ton of time creating a README. When creating an open source project it's invaluable to have a quality README that has in depth informatiion about the application. The purpose of the app, the use of the app, installation, reporting issues, and how to contribute to the project. A README created on the command-line will surely expedite the process.
